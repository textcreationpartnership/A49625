            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>In a sweet smelling grove went smiling along</l>
               <l>Till the youth gave a vent to his heart with his tongue;</l>
               <l>Ah <hi>Silvia,</hi> said he, and sigh'd when he spoke,</l>
               <l>Your cruel resolve will you never revoke:</l>

               <l>Ah <hi>Philander,</hi> she said, 'tis a dangerous bliss;</l>
               <l>Ah never ask more, and I'll give thee a kiss.</l>

               <l>No, never, she said, and then trip'd to a Bow'r.</l>
               <l>She stopt at the Wicket; he cry'd let me in;</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Astella, Astella!</hi> is all my sad cry:</l>

                  <l>Embraces and kisses his Nymph, while she sings;</l>
                  <l>And his life's to be envy'd by the greatest of Kings.</l>

               <head>A Rustick Song.</head>
               <l>MY gaffer and gammer were fast in their Nest,</l>
               <l>And all the young Fry of their Cribs were possest,</l>
               <l>Spot, VVhite-foot, and Puss, in the ashes were spread,</l>
               <l>And a Blinking Rush-candle stuck over their head.</l>
               <l>Sweet <hi>Ursly</hi> was washing the Trenchers and Platter,</l>
               <l>Preparing to make her good friend, the Hogg, fatter;</l>
               <l>Greaz'd up to the Elbows, and smutch'd to the Eyes,</l>
               <l>And her rich broider'd cloath's were as fat as her thighs.</l>
               <l>Like Bag-pipes her Cheeks, and her Udders chin-high,</l>
               <l>Her Nose hawking out, bended both ways awry;</l>
               <l>Her lips were as thick as her squint-eyes were blinking,</l>
               <l>And her Orient locks were most rankishly stinking.</l>
               <l>VVhile <hi>Roger</hi> the Plow-man lay close by a snoring,</l>
               <l>God Cupid was vext at his Clownish adoring;</l>
               <l>And therefore conveys to his great Logger-head,</l>
               <l>In a whisper, the news that all were a'bed,</l>
               <l>Up <hi>Roger</hi> starts then, and rubbing his eyes,</l>
               <l>To his dearest sweet <hi>Ursly</hi> with passion he flies;</l>
               <l>And lolling his Elbows on <hi>Ursly's</hi> broad back,</l>
               <l>Complains that his heart was e'n ready to crack.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Ursly</hi> displeas'd with the weight of her love,</l>
               <l>(O Cupid why dost thou thus treacherous prove?)</l>
               <l>As fast as she cou'd she turn'd her about,</l>
               <l>And with Dish-clout slopt o're the wretch'd face of our Lowt.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:42115:10"/>
               <l>Now Cupid thou're fit to be kick'd out of doors,</l>
               <l>Since a Pimp thou dost prove to such fulsom amours;</l>
               <l>But Cupid is onely a hope to obtain,</l>
               <l>What is out of our reach seldome causes our pain,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Roger</hi> at Market had frequently seen,</l>
               <l>Such beauties, good Lawi, each look'd like a Queen;</l>
               <l>Yet his heart all the while did continue his own,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Ursly,</hi> ah! <hi>Ursly,</hi> but seen and it's gone.</l>
